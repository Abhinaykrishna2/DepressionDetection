Depression is a prevalent and significant medical disorder that significantly affects emotions,  thoughts, and behaviors. As such, early detection and care are necessary to limit its severe repercussions, which include suicide and self-harm. 
Determining who is suffering from mental health issues is a difficult task that has historically relied on techniques such as patient interviews and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (DAS) scores.
Acknowledging the shortcomings of traditional methods, this study seeks to develop a model designed especially for the early detection of depression and to provide individualized recommendations for interventions. 
Instead of verbal self-evaluation, this approach interprets emotional indicators that are subtle but indicative of depression symptoms using facial image analysis.  
This creative approach offers a possibly more approachable way to recognize and treat depression in addition to expanding the possibilities for detection. 
By deciphering subtle changes in facial expressions, CNN (Code work is going on to incorporate EfficientNet B0) to evaluate emotional well-being more objectively. 
Our goal is to use image processing to identify symptoms of depression by utilizing CNN and EFFICIENT NET B0 architecture. 
In addition, I developed a Python and JavaScript WebSocket chatbot to gather patient feedback, forecast DAS scores for mental health assessments, and provide prescriptions based on the responses from GPT-3.5 API. This real-time technology tackles mental health head-on and offers an easy-to-use interface.
The execution of the code starts from a1.html. While proceeding to use the chatbot, remember to host your JS websocket server.
